* Welcome!
** The Lost Art of Single File Ruby Programs
A loose collection of Ruby fun facts and examples to organize your code in a single file.

Let's have some fun with Ruby!
#+begin_notes
This talk is based on the time when I learned Ruby, around 2008
Ruby is a very concise language, so it actually made sense that
you put a lot of stuff in one file, as it actually might work out fine.

I was always kind of fascinated by this

This talk is a loose collection of ruby fun facts that you might or might not know
together with some practical examples
#+end_notes
* Code & tests in one file
** Ruby Magic Constants
There is ~$0~.

#+begin_quote
Contains the name of the file containing the Ruby script being executed.

** The source file
#+begin_src ruby
def greet(name)
  "Hello #{name}!"
end

# this will only run if the script was the main
# not load'd or require'd
if __FILE__ == $0
  require "test/unit/assertions"
  include Test::Unit::Assertions

  assert_equal 'Hello Ruby', greet('Ruby'), "greet function should return 'Hello Ruby!'"
end
#+end_src
** When called directly
#+begin_src sh
$ ruby code_and_test.rb
 greet function should return 'Hello Ruby!'. (Test::Unit::AssertionFailedError)
<"Hello Ruby"> expected but was
<"Hello Ruby!">.

diff:
- Hello Ruby
+ Hello Ruby!
?
#+end_src
** When required
#+begin_src ruby
require './code_and_test.rb'

puts greet "Christian"
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
$ ruby code_and_test_usage.rb
Hello Christian!
#+end_src
** You may know this from Python
#+begin_src python
def hello():
    print("Hello world, this script was called!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()
#+end_src

* A webserver in one file?
** My life before Ruby
Before Ruby, my favorite web framework was [[https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/tree/432019cdc654fad0b866a2b9ea7483f233ec811d][CodeIgniter]].

Security first: One index.html file in *EVERY* folder.
** Sinatra 0.6
#+begin_src ruby
sudo gem install sinatra
#+end_src

#+begin_notes
sudo, because bundler was not invented yet ;)
#+end_notes

#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_src ruby
require "rubygems"
require "sinatra"

get '/' do
 "Hello World"
end
#+end_src

Awesome!!!

#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_src sh
ruby myapp.rb
#+end_src
** Templates: Uncool way
"You can do this too but it's not as cool" - Sinatra Readme

#+begin_src ruby
template :index do
  '%div.title Hello World!'
end
#+end_src
** Templates
As documented in the [[https://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra/tree/d2e256a957c6f3ddb65a004c5759f54e74240272#in-file-templates-][README.rdoc]] this was the cool way to do it.

#+begin_src ruby

  haml :index

* A little Ruby history
** Ruby is a better Perl
Why the name 'Ruby'?

#+begin_quote
Influenced by Perl, Matz wanted to use a jewel name for his new language, so he named Ruby after a colleague's birthstone.
#+end_quote

Source: [[https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/FAQ/FAQ.html][The Ruby Language FAQ]]
** Perl's legacy
Ruby took a lot of things from Pearl.

Today we will learn about:

- Keywords
- Command line flags
** Let's start with Perldata
Perl has two special literals:
- ~__END__~ - Indicates the logical end of the script before the actual end of file. Any following text is ignored.
- ~__DATA__~ - A filehandle that points to everything that comes after ~__END__~.

Source: [[https://perldoc.perl.org/perldata.html#Special-Literals][perldata - perldoc.perl.org]]
* The ~__END__~ and =DATA= keywords
#+begin_quote
Denotes the end of the regular source code section of a program file. Lines below ~__END__~ will not be executed.
#+end_quote

#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_quote
Those lines will be available via the special filehandle ~DATA~
#+end_quote

Source: [[https://ruby-doc.org/docs/keywords/1.9/Object.html#method-i-__END__][Class: Object]]
** Simple Example
#+begin_src ruby
DATA.each_line do |line|
  puts line
end

__END__
Cats
Dogs
Mice
#+end_src
** ERB template and code in one file
#+begin_src ruby
require 'erb'

time = Time.now
renderer = ERB.new(DATA.read)
puts renderer.result()

__END__
The current time is <%= time %>.
#+end_src
** Explained: Sinatra Style Multiple Templates in File
#+begin_src ruby
get '/' do
  haml :index
end

use_in_file_templates!

File.read(caller.first.split(":").first).split("__END__", 2).last
#+end_src

Source: [[https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/data-and-end-in-ruby/][Mixing code and data in Ruby]]
** PSA: PHP can do it as well
#+begin_src php
// open self
$fp = fopen(__FILE__, 'rb');
// seek file pointer to data
//__COMPILER_HALT_OFFSET__ will return
//the point after __halt_compiler();
fseek($fp, __COMPILER_HALT_OFFSET__);
// and output it
$unpacked = gzinflate(stream_get_contents($fp));
__halt_compiler();
//now here... all the binary gzdeflate already items!!!
#+end_src

Source: [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.halt-compiler.php][PHP: __halt_compiler - Manual]]

* Bundler inline
Fun fact: You don't need a =Gemfile= to use bundler!

Useful for scripts in your =/utils= folder that you only use once a year.

Source: [[https://bundler.io/guides/bundler_in_a_single_file_ruby_script.html][How to use Bundler in a single-file Ruby script]]
** Inline HTTParty
#+begin_src ruby
require 'bundler/inline'

gemfile do
  gem 'httparty'
end

puts HTTParty.get('https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity')
#+end_src
** Inline Minitest
#+begin_src ruby
require 'bundler/inline'

gemfile do
  gem 'minitest', require: false
end

require 'minitest/autorun'

class MyTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_should_be_true
    assert_equal true, true
  end
end
#+end_src
* Advanced Example: Download iCal to org
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Install Dependencies
- Do stuff (download calendar events)
- Render to ERb template

* =BEGIN= and =END= Keywords
Yes, this is taken from Perl as well.

** Definition
#+begin_quote
BEGIN defines a block that is run before any other code in the current file. It is typically used in one-liners with ruby -e.

Similarly END defines a block that is run after any other code.
#+end_quote

Source: [[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.2.0/syntax/miscellaneous_rdoc.html#label-BEGIN+and+END][Documentation for Ruby 2.2.0]]
** Example
#+begin_src ruby
END { puts 3 }
BEGIN { puts 1 }
puts 2
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
ruby begin.rb
1

3
#+end_src
* Introducing LRuby
Logging Ruby - The Ruby alias for the forgetful scripter
Logging Ruby!

Only Feature:
No more scrolling through your terminal...
Logs the output of a script to the script itself!
** Let's try this out
#+begin_src sh
cat log_results/hello_world.rb
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
ruby log_results/hello_world.rb
#+end_src

** Introducing: LRuby
#+begin_src sh
lruby log_results/hello_world.rb
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
cat log_results/hello_world.rb
#+end_src
** How does it work?
#+begin_src sh
which lruby
#+end_src

Let's check out the source of [[file:lruby.rb::BEGIN {][LRuby lruby.rb]]
* The Garbage Flag
Aaaaand back to Perl!
** Perlrun
#+begin_src sh
perl -x
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
Leading garbage will be discarded until the first line that starts with #! and contains the string "perl".
#+end_quote

Source: [[https://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html][perlrun - perldoc.perl.org]]
** But... Why?
#+begin_quote
Tells Perl that the program is embedded in a larger chunk of unrelated text, such as in a *mail message*.
#+end_quote
** And in Ruby..
#+begin_src sh
ruby -x
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
Tells Ruby that the script is embedded in a message. Leading garbage will be discarded until the first that starts with "#!" and contains string "ruby".
#+end_quote

Source: [[https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/Manual/man-1.4/options.html][Ruby Docs Command line Options]]
** Example
#+begin_src ruby
Hello dear friend,
this is a mail message. Please execute it with your ruby interpreter.

Thanks,
a random stranger
#! hahaha this is ruby now
puts "Hello World"
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
ruby -x email.eml
#+end_src
* A self-animating GIF
This is not an animated gif, but a gif that animates itself.
** Let's talk about GIFs
[[./assets/bunny.gif]]
*** A GIF file consists of blocks
[[./assets/gif_file_stream.gif]]
*** Example
[[./assets/gif_file_stream2.png]]
*** Terminator Byte
The trailer block indicates when you've reached the end of the file. It is always a byte with a value of =3B=.

Source: [[http://giflib.sourceforge.net/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.html][What's In A GIF]]
** Soooo now we know that..
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- GIFs are nice
- GIFs always end with the same terminator byte
- Ruby is nice
- Ruby can start with a defined start line
- Nice.
** A self-animating GIF
This is not an animated gif, but a gif that animates itself.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- One file
- Upper half is a GIF
- Lower half is Ruby code
- File rewrites itself!
- Profit!
** Source Code
Let's check out the [[file:rbgif/rbgif.gif::#!->let's go ruby!][rbgif.gif source code]] together!
** LIVE DEMO!
#+begin_src sh
while 1; do cd ~/Dropbox/slides/single-file-ruby-programs/rbgif; time ruby -x ./rbgif.gif; sleep 0.1; done
#+end_src
* One more thing...
#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/sh

echo This is bash
i=12
echo $i

perl - $i <<'__HERE__'
my $i = shift;
print "This is perl\n";
print ++$i . "\n";
__HERE__

echo This is bash again
echo $i
#+end_src

** Perlmonks.org 2000 Testimonials
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- "Ain't that fun?" - dchetlin
- "It's strange and terrible and I'm not sure how to get something out of the perl part, but this sort of works" - eg
- "This, on the other hand is just ... just .. well, I don't know. Not right. Not even wrong. It just is." - Blue
